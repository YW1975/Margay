## General Guidelines

1. **Authenticity** — Write as a person, not a brand
2. **Value first** — Every post should provide value (info, insight, tool, question)
3. **Platform-native** — Adapt tone and format to each platform
4. **No spam** — Quality over quantity
5. **Timing** — Post when your audience is active (usually weekday mornings)
6. **Engagement** — Reply to comments on your own posts within 24h
